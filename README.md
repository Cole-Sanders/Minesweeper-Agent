# Minesweeper-Agent
In this project, three types of AI agents were created to solve the game Minesweeper and their effectiveness was compared. The three agents used were a knowledge-based constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) agent, a stochastic/probablistic agent, and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The repositiory contains two files: the code itself and the research paper analysis.
